# Digital Guidelines
This document contains additional data supporting the Paper “Digitalising Guidelines: Requirement Definition and Compliance Enforcement in BIM Models”. The presented use cases demonstrate our method for the generation and application of digital guidelines in the AEC industry.

## Use Cases Based On the ISO 6946:2017, Section 6.7.2

It is to be noted that Section 6.7.2 describes a simplified method for the calculation of the total thermal resistance of a building component. This method is based on one typical part of the component, not on the entire component. For detailed calculations taking thermal bridges into account there is the ISO 10211. 

### Use Case 1: ISO 6946:2017, Section 6.7.2 applied to a Generic Data Model
