# Digital Guidelines
This document contains additional data supporting the Paper “Digitalising Guidelines: Requirement Definition and Compliance Enforcement in BIM Models”. The presented use cases demonstrate our method for the generation and application of digital guidelines in the AEC industry.

## Use Cases Based On the ISO 6946:2017, Section 6.7.2

It is to be noted that Section 6.7.2 describes a simplified method for the calculation of the total thermal resistance of a building component. This method is based on one typical part of the component, not on the entire component. For detailed calculations taking thermal bridges into account there is the ISO 10211.

Fig.1 demonstrates the difference between the entire construction, e.g., wall, and a representative, or typical, part. For example, Fig.1(a) shows a 0.40m section of the wall that contains both a timber column and the insulation between two columns. This section represents the inhomogeneous layer with the correct ratio of materials, which is enough for the application of the guideline. Fig.1(b) shows a more complex construction with three inhomogeneous layers. The representative section here is larger, 1.00m long, since it requires all combinations of inhomogeneities to be accounted for.

*Fig.2. Wall decomposition: (b) in geometric profiles, (c) in cells according to ISO 6946:2017, Section 6.7.2.*

The next question is one of modelling. Fig.2 shows the different ways the wall from Fig.1(b) can be decomposed into model elements. The model in Fig.2(b) groups adjacent elements of the same material, while the model in Fig.2(c) decomposes the typical section in layers and section in accordance with ISO 6946:2017, Section 6.7.2.2, Figure 1. Consequently, the two approaches produce models of vastly different sizes.

However, a model resulting from Fig.2(b) can be adapted to fulfil the requirements of the model resulting from Fig.2(c). We will demonstrate this on the following use cases.

### Use Case 1: ISO 6946:2017, Section 6.7.2 applied to a Generic Data Model

The first use case involves the modelling of the wall presented in Fig.1(a). We have chosen a fairly generic data model that could represent the architect’s view. It is shown in the box in Fig.3(a). Abstract type *Element* can have *Data* attached to it.
